Ensure you have the necessary extensions installed for the language you're programming in (e.g., Python, JavaScript, C++, etc.). These extensions provide language-specific debugging support.
Open Your Project:

Open VS Code and navigate to the folder containing your project files.
Create or Open a Debug Configuration:

Click on the Debugging icon in the Activity Bar on the side (or use Ctrl+Shift+D).
Click on the gear icon that says "create a launch.json file" or edit an existing launch.json file if one exists. This file specifies how VS Code should start and debug your program.

10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.

    Initializing a Repository:
Open Your Project in VS Code:

Launch VS Code and open the folder or workspace of your project.
Initialize Git Repository:

Open the Source Control view by clicking on the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar on the side (or use Ctrl+Shift+G).
Click on the Initialize Repository button (or Initialize Git Repository... if you have an existing repository).
Alternatively, you can open a terminal in VS Code (Ctrl+ ` backtick) and run git init to initialize a Git repository manually.
Making Commits:
Stage Changes:

In the Source Control view, you'll see a list of files with changes.
Click the + button next to a file to stage it for commit. Alternatively, stage all changes by clicking the + button at the top (Stage All Changes).
Commit Changes:

Enter a commit message in the text box that says "Message (press Ctrl+Enter to commit)" at the top of the Source Control view.
Press Ctrl+Enter (or click the check mark ✔️ button) to commit your changes.
Pushing Changes to GitHub:
Create a GitHub Repository (if not already created):

Go to GitHub and create a new repository, or use an existing one where you have permission to push changes.
Set Remote Repository:

After committing your changes locally, click on the ellipsis (...) next to the repository name in the Source Control view.
Choose Remote > Add Remote....
Enter the URL of your GitHub repository and a name for the remote (commonly origin).
Click Add Remote.
Push Changes:

Once the remote is set, you can push your committed changes to GitHub.
Click on the ellipsis (...) again next to the repository name in the Source Control view.
Choose Push to push your changes to the remote repository.
You might be prompted to authenticate with GitHub if you haven't done so already.
Additional Tips:
Branching and Merging:

Use the Source Control view to create new branches (Ctrl+Shift+P and type Git: Create Branch...) and merge changes (Git: Merge Branch...).
Pulling Changes:

Use Git: Pull from the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) to fetch and merge changes from the remote repository to your local repository.
Visual Diff:

VS Code integrates with Git to provide a visual diff view for comparing changes between different versions of files.
Extensions:

Consider installing Git-related extensions from the VS Code Marketplace for additional functionality and integration with Git workflows.
